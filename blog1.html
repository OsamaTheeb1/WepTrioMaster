                            <p>1. Inspecting the Car Before Receiving It
                                Proper Inspection:
                                Check the car's exterior and interior condition. Ensure there are no scratches or damages already present, and ask the staff to record these damages.
                                
                                Essential Equipment:
                                Make sure the car contains the necessary emergency tools, such as:
                                
                                Spare tire
                                Tire wrench
                                Jack (car lift)
                                Bottles filled with water<br>
                                2. Insurance and Coverage
                                Choosing the Right Insurance:
                                Ensure that you are covered by comprehensive insurance against accidents and damages. Some offers may include insurance, but make sure to verify if you need to purchase additional coverage.
                                
                                Insurance Policy:
                                Ensure you fully understand the insurance policy, such as whether it covers all types of damages or not, and whether there is any deductible in case of an accident.<br>
                                
                                3. Fuel Policy
                                Fuel Policy:
                                Some companies follow a "full tank for full tank" policy, meaning you must return the car with the same fuel level it had when you received it. Make sure you are aware of this policy before receiving the car.
